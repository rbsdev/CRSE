The files wsj-nns-vb and wsj-nns-vb-stems contain the plural nouns & verbs and
their stems, respectively, from the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank, as computed
by the morpha tool.

Sample commands for creating these files (with directories on the OSU
Linguistics system) are in get_wsj_nns_vb and stem_wsj_nns_vb.

There are also some made-up sentences for testing the parser and
realizer in novel/two-sents, and an example CCGbank file with Propbank
roles and corrections in the sample dir.
