General OpenCCG development:
----------------------------

- Add check for target LF when adding/writing full words (incl. supertags).

- Look into better handling of optional args.

- Extend feature hierarchy biz to work with category types; 
  would make sense to also add category vars.

- Add final bits to grammars rough guide (esp. feature licensing).
  
- Add option to update testbed.

- Binding theory?
  
- Get agreement to work with anaphors in appositives.

- Add more dynamic checks, eg for non-existent indexRel values or licensing attrs.

- Add well-formedness check for unique roles -- ie, that role must occur
  only once per semantic head -- and associated method for declaring that
  roles must be unique.

- Interface to morph transducers.

- Make UnifyControl etc thread friendly.  Could try tying global vars to
  current thread.

- Improve unification efficiency.  Could try indexing, caching across calls
  to parser or realizer, and structure sharing with delayed copying. 



Realizer-oriented development:
------------------------------

- Try using coarticulations with pitch accents.

- Add orthographic post-processing (capitalization, spacing of punctuation).

- Look into instantiating outermost args. 








TODO prior to Feb 16:
---------------------

Tabs for testbed, lexicon, features
Nice tree graph for features
Get Arabic to compile
Issues of colors, fonts, etc. (Alexis help)
PNG's of the slash modalities
Option menu for different magnification (50%, 100%, 200% ...)
Get pretty buttons from Justin
Make sure all path, etc. issues are working
Figure out what's the deal with __init__.py -- importing from another dir

Possibly:
  help-over descriptions of families, provided by Javadoc-style comments in
  the source


Alexis -- help with more specific user-interface issues, overall management
involving various people

Sudipta --
  -- PNG's of slash modalities; add to editor
  -- TeX/Tk font conversion
  -- find a Tkinter package for displaying tree graphs; use it to add a graph for features to the editor
  -- figure out what's wrong with arabic?

semantics: RED
features: BLUE
categories: BLACK, sans serif font
