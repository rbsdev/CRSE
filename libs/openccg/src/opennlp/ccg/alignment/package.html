<p>This package provides classes for modeling alignments between two
phrases.</p>

<p>
The {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.Phrase} class models a phrase as simply
a list of words. A single alignment between an index in one phrase and an index
in another is captured by the {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.Mapping} class. The
{@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.Alignment} class is build on top of Phrase and
Mapping, encapsulating an &quot;A&quot; phrase and a &quot;B&quot; phrase
along with a set of mappings between them (see
{@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.PhrasePosition}).
</p>

<p>
Since there are multiple different encoding schemes for representing alignments,
a goal of this package is to make the conceptual representation of aligned phrases
as independent of encoding as possible. The interface
{@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.EncodingScheme} gives a way to represent
encoding schemes, and two popular encoding schemes (Moses and NAACL) are provided by this
package. Different encoding schemes use different
numbering bases: some start numbering indices at 0 and some at 1. To reconcile this
difference, the class {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.IndexBase} provides a way to translate
different numbering bases into a common index base. The {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.MappingFormat}
class extends {@link java.text.Format} to give encoding-independent formatting and parsing
for mappings.
</p>

<p>
The classes {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.PhraseReader} and {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.PhraseWriter}
(and their descendants), {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.MappingReader} and
{@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.MappingWriter} provide convenient ways to read and write phrases
and mappings. Lastly, the non-instantiable class {@link opennlp.ccg.alignment.Alignments} provides some
convenience methods for reading phrases, mappings and alignments.
