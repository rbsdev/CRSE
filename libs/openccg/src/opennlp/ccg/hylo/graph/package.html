<p>Provides representations of {@link opennlp.ccg.synsem.LF}s as traversible graphs based
on the <a href="http://jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> package, as well as customized filters for
sets of edges in those graphs.</p>

<p>{@link opennlp.ccg.hylo.graph.LFGraph}s can be created on their own, or from an existing
{@link opennlp.ccg.synsem.LF} (or XML structure representing one) using the
{@link opennlp.ccg.hylo.graph.LFGraphFactory}. LF graphs are also
customizable in that different edge factories can be specified by implementing
{@link opennlp.ccg.hylo.graph.LFEdgeFactory} (a default implementation is provided in
{@link opennlp.ccg.hylo.graph.DefaultLFEdgeFactory}).</p>
